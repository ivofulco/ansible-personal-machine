Creating an Ansible playbook to automate the installation of software on remote Ubuntu machines is a great idea. Below is a sample Ansible playbook that achieves the tasks you've mentioned: installing Visual Studio Code (vscode), Docker, Ubuntu updates, DBeaver Community Edition, and Lens on both the source and target Ubuntu machines.

Step 1: Install Ansible
Before you proceed, make sure Ansible is installed on your source machine. You can install Ansible using the following command:

`sudo apt update;
sudo apt install ansible`

Step 2: Create the Playbook File
Create a file named install_software.yml and add the following content:

Replace your_inventory_group_name with the name of the inventory group that contains your target Ubuntu machines.

Step 3: Create the Ansible Inventory File
Create a file named inventory.ini and add the IP addresses or hostnames of your target Ubuntu machines under the appropriate inventory group. For example:

Replace target_machine_ip_or_hostname with the IP address or hostname of your target machine, and your_ssh_username with your SSH username.

Step 4: Execute the Ansible Playbook
Open a terminal on your source machine and navigate to the directory containing the playbook and inventory files.

Run the following command to execute the playbook:

`ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini install_software.yml`

Ansible will connect to the target machine using SSH and execute the tasks defined in the playbook. The software installation and configuration will be performed on the target machine.

Please note that some tasks in the playbook might require elevated privileges, hence the use of become: yes. Also, the reboot task is included to ensure that changes like Docker group membership take effect. If you don't want to reboot, you can remove the last task from the playbook.

Remember to review and test the playbook in a controlled environment before applying it to production machines.
